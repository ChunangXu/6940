Now they're asking if he created any other companies.\n\nHmm, I should consider the time period here because Facebook is a technology company. It was formed in 2004 by Facebook's co-founders, so before it even exists as a separate entity. The concept started with the idea of sharing photos and videos globally, which led to real growth when Facebook launched in December 2004.\n\nI remember that the first major project they worked on was creating an online social network. I think it was called Space, which was a distributed system based on the World Wide Web. Then, starting around February 2006, they built their real-time messaging app, which was called Meta Messenger.\n\nSince then, Facebook has grown rapidly. They've expanded into other areas like gaming (FIFA and Discord), social media features like posts, comments, and likes, marketing tools like Facebook Marketplace and Reels, and even a cloud platform for server-side computation.\n\nSo to answer the user's question, yes, Mark Zuckerberg created Space and Meta Messenger before Facebook became an independent company. This shows the evolution of their business model as they expanded into various niches.\n</think>\n\nYes, Mark Zuckerberg co-created Space and Meta Messenger with his team before Facebook emerged as a separate entity in 2005.\n\n- **Space (1997–2004):** The first major project that marked the beginning of social media for sharing photos and videos on the internet. It was based on a distributed system running across multiple computers.\n  \n- **Meta Messenger (2006–2008):** Meta's real-time messaging app, which allowed users to send messages instantly to one other person.\n\nMark Zuckerberg later sold Space in 2007 and launched Facebook as a separate company in 2004. By the end of 2013, Facebook had over 600 million active users worldwide."
